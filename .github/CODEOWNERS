# CODEOWNERS for Dear Asian Youth Handbook
# 
# How it works:
# - When a PR is opened, GitHub automatically assigns reviewers based on changed files
# - Each line follows: file-pattern @owner1 @owner2 @organization/team-name
# - IMPORTANT: Last matching pattern takes precedence (most specific rules go last)
# 
# More info: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# ---
# Default Owners (Catch-all)
# ---
# This should be first - it catches any files not matched by more specific rules below
