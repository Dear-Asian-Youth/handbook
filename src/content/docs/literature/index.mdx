Through articles, prose, poetry, art, and music, the Literature Team diversifies the Asian narrative and builds awareness of issues of global significance. We use writing and visuals to highlight underrepresented communities and foster empathy, solidarity, and allyship within and beyond the Asian community.

### What we do

- Publish pieces by DAY literature members and outside submitters
- Publish seasonal zine issues focused on timely themes
