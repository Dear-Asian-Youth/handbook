Through the publication of articles, prose, poetry, art, and music, the Literature Team aims to diversify the Asian narrative and bring newfound awareness to issues of global significance. We hope to use writing and visuals to shed light on underrepresented communities and foster empathy, solidarity, and allyship both within and beyond the Asian community.

## Our Mission

We believe in the power of storytelling to transform perspectives, challenge stereotypes, and create connection. By providing a platform for diverse Asian voices, we work to counteract monolithic narratives and celebrate the rich complexity of Asian experiences worldwide.
