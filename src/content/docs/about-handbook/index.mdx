This handbook is the living documentation for our organizationâ€”a single source of truth that grows and evolves with us.

## Our Philosophy

Built with the philosophy that documentation should be accessible, comprehensive, and always up-to-date. Like [GitLab's handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/), we believe in transparency, working publicly, and creating a resource that serves as the definitive source for how we operate.

### Key Principles

- **Living Document** - Always evolving, never static
- **Transparency** - Open by default, accessible to all
- **Comprehensive** - One source of truth for everything
- **Community-Driven** - Built by and for our team
- **Accessible** - Easy to find, easy to understand, easy to contribute
