The Diversity & Inclusion Task Force (DITF) was founded in November 2020, six months after DAY, to diversify DAY's content and ensure a safe, inclusive, and diverse space for all community members. The DITF upholds DAY's commitment to diversity and inclusion across programs and initiatives.

### What we do

- Diversify DAY content across platforms
- Foster a safe, inclusive environment for all community members
- Advise teams to embed diversity and inclusion in programs and policies
- Track progress and uphold DAY's values across initiatives
