The Diversity & Inclusion Task Force (DITF) was founded in November 2020, six months after DAY was founded. As a department, the DITF was established with the intention to diversify DAY content and ensure that DAY is a safe, inclusive, and diverse space for all community members.

## Our Mission

The DITF works to ensure that DAY is committed to its values of diversity and inclusion. We take a proactive approach to examining our organizational practices, content, and community spaces to identify and address areas where we can better serve underrepresented voices within the Asian community and beyond.

## What We Do

- **Content Diversity Review** - Ensure DAY's content represents the full spectrum of Asian experiences
- **Community Safety** - Develop and enforce policies that maintain safe, inclusive spaces
- **Education & Training** - Provide resources and workshops on diversity, equity, and inclusion
- **Policy Development** - Create and refine organizational policies that center equity and inclusion
- **Accountability** - Hold DAY accountable to its stated values of diversity and inclusion

## Core Values

- **Intersectionality** - Recognizing that identity is multifaceted and experiences vary
- **Representation** - Amplifying underrepresented voices within the Asian community
- **Continuous Learning** - Committing to ongoing education and growth
- **Proactive Action** - Taking initiative to create change, not just responding to issues
- **Community-Centered** - Centering the needs and voices of our community members
