## Who We Are

Dear Asian Youth (DAY) is an international non-profit organization dedicated to uplift and empower young Asians. Through digital media, grassroots initiatives, and leadership programs, we advocate for equity, intersectional solidarity, and social change.

At its core, our mission is to amplify underrepresented voices. We recognize that Asian identity isn’t one-size-fits-all—it’s complex, diverse, and deeply intersectional. That’s why we’re here: to share our stories, challenge global narratives, and create space for every experience.

## What We Do

- Advocacy & Community Building — A global platform driving real-world change through activism and leadership.
- Dear Asian Generation Podcast (formerly Dear Asian Girl) — sparks conversations by exploring identity, activism, and culture through the lens of Asian experiences. See our podcast at [/podcast](/podcast).
- Publications & Creative Expression — 400+ pieces, including essays, poetry, and zines, showcasing diversity and holistic Asian representation. Explore publications at [/literature](/literature).

## Our Impact

- 200+ team members across 10+ countries
- 100+ chapters leading local grassroots initiatives
- 90k+ followers across our social media platforms

Founded in 2020 by Stephanie Hu. Today, DAY is led by Executive Director Saoud Moon and Vice President Parveen Mundi.
