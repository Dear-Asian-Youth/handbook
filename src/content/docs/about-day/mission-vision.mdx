## Our Mission

To amplify underrepresented Asian voices and advocate for equity, intersectional solidarity, and social change through storytelling, education, and activism.

## Our Vision

A world where Asian youth are seen, heard, and empowered to lead change—one that embraces the complexity, diversity, and intersectionality of Asian identity.
