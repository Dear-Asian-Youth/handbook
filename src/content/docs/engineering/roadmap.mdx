## Key Initiatives

- Complete the DAY website and hand over to marketing for independent updates
- Publish paper on nonbinary representation in LLMs
- Build Programming's resource library
- Launch department-wide Notion templates for project management
- Migrate internal systems to cost-effective, self-hosted solutions
  - Ghost (for Literature/Marketing)
  - Mattermost (alternative to Slack)
  - Frappe HR
- Launch DAY's handbook and design system
- Begin ethical AI usage policy across departments
- Formalize internal cybersecurity practices

## 3-Year Vision

- Launch the Programming Department's resource library website
- Scale opensource automation and internal tooling across all departments
- Submit at least 2 research papers rooted in DAY Engineering's projects
- Begin earning through consulting and setup of the nonprofit software starter pack
- Establish DAY Engineering as a recognised name in ethical tech circles
  - Contribute to Foundation for Humane Technology, Humane Intelligence, ML Ethics bounties, etc.
- Expand grant-based funding and reduce dependency on sponsorships

## Nonprofit Software Starter Pack

We're developing a comprehensive **Nonprofit Software Starter Pack** that creates a self-sustaining loop:

**DAY becomes a tech leader in the nonprofit space → builds public goods → earns through setup & support**

The starter pack includes:
- Website templates with Payload CMS
- Frappe HR for human resources management
- Analytics with Plausible
- Secure chat with Mattermost
- Project management with Notion templates or open-source alternatives

This builds reputation, recruits contributors, and opens new funding pipelines including GitHub Sponsors and NLNet grants.

## Success Metrics

Our progress is measured by:

- Reduction in volunteer burnout and churn
- Decreased technical debt from patchwork solutions
- Improved data-driven decision making across departments
- Growth in revenue-generating initiatives
- Increased grants and funding from open-source contributions
