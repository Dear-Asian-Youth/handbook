Engineering is overhauling unscalable, ad-hoc systems to build ethical, open-source infrastructure for our 200+ members. We're replacing privacy-violating tools with self-hosted, maintainable, and mission-aligned alternatives.

## Our Mission

**Engineering builds and maintains scalable, open-source and cost-effective software systems that directly support our mission of DEI and advocacy.** We are an interdisciplinary technical team embedded in an advocacy nonprofit, bridging tech and activism to reduce organizational friction and increase operational capacity.

### Key Goals

- **Rebuild digital infrastructure** prioritizing privacy, scalability, interoperability, and ethical design
- **Develop talent** through a learning-focused, inclusive engineering culture with mentorship opportunities and real-world impact
- **Enable user-centered design** through ethical UX, avoiding dark patterns
- **Enable long-term, scalable growth** by implementing proper infrastructure and project management tools
- **Fix technical debt** caused by non-scalable patchwork solutions
- **Support cross-departmental tooling** and resource development

## Strategic Vision: Nonprofit Software Starter Pack

We're developing a comprehensive **Nonprofit Software Starter Pack**—website templates with Payload, Frappe HR, analytics with Plausible, secure chat with Mattermost, and project management with Notion templates or open-source alternatives.

This creates a self-sustaining loop where we become tech leaders in the nonprofit space → build public goods → earn through setup & support. The starter pack builds reputation, recruits contributors, and opens new funding pipelines including GitHub Sponsors and NLNet grants.
